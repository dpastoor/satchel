## access behavior

when 'using' an object, the default behavior is to re-scan the satchel tree to make

objects on after another (for example, pulling in a bunch to a list). To manually control the behavior, you can turn off refreshing via

```
satchel$auto_refresh(FALSE) 
satchel$available() # manually query the tree to update it
satchel$use(...)
satchel$use(...)
satchel$use(...)
satchel$use(...)
satchel$auto_refresh(TRUE) # turn auto-refresh back on

```
